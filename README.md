#Downloading code snapshots

You can download all the content of a branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either clone the repository or simply download the selected branch content as a ZIP file.

#Running the attached code

To run the code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run `npm install` to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).

The use `npm start` to run the server on localhost.
